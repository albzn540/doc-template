# Readme template

In order to make better readmes I created this readme template that includes everything of importance.

_This readme is for simplistic resasons not based on that template. I mean, this is a template, not a project._

Take me to the [template](TEMPLATE.md)

## Acknowledgements
This template is heavily based upon [BEST-README-template](https://github.com/othneildrew/Best-README-Template) by [othneildrew](https://github.com/othneildrew). Cudos to that person!
